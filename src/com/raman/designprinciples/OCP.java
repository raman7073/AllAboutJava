/**
  * Software Entities (Classes ,Modules,Methods,etc.) should be open for

  * Open in Open_closed Principle means that classes are
  * open for inheritance & methods can be overridden
  * and closed means existing base classes should not be
  * modified.
  * As for ex :
  * There should be a base class which is closed for
  * modification ,and we can have derived class where we can
  * override methods to extend the behaviour.So it is open for extension.
