 *  Dependency Inversion Principle
 *  A. High Level Modules should not depend upon low level modules .
 *  Both should depend upon abstractions.
 *  B. Abstractions should not depend upon details.
 *  Details should depend upon abstractions.

 *  And It means that code should not create objects
 *  of all of its dependencies itself . Dependencies
 *  should be provided to the code from outside.
